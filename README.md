@manmohansingh -
    The assignment still lacks Data Listeners in order to modify,
    delete and find the existing data, since the data entered
    into the fields upon running the application is not being
    written into any external file.
    The UI still lack fields in order assign date to the tasks
    and projects; as well as the importance band.
    The application is unable to calculate urgency of any task by
    making mathematical comparisons with the other tasks or 
    projects; or by keeping a check on estimated duration.

    The assignment needs to have Test cases in order to handle
    various common Errors and preventing user from making
    such (Error Handling).

    Majority of the Data Model still lacks comments which would be added
    later upon the course of this assignment.
